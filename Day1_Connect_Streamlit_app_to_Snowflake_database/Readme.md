# 🚀 30 Days of AI — Day 1: Connect Streamlit to Snowflake

This repository documents my **30 Days of AI challenge**, where I build and understand AI-enabled applications using **Streamlit** and **Snowflake**.

Day 1 focuses on establishing a **working connection between Streamlit and Snowflake** and validating it by running a simple query.

---

## 🎯 Day 1 Goal

The goal for Day 1 is to:

* Connect a Streamlit app to a Snowflake database
* Execute a SQL query from Streamlit
* Display the Snowflake version inside the app

A successful run confirms that:

* Streamlit is correctly authenticated
* Snowflake connectivity works
* SQL queries can be executed from Python

## 🧠 Challenge Context

The **#30DaysOfAI** challenge is designed to help developers get hands-on experience building AI and data apps using Streamlit.

> **Note:** The learning is platform-agnostic. While this challenge uses Snowflake, the same concepts apply to other databases and AI providers.
